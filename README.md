# Sales-and-Revenue-Analysis-Dashboard (AirTraffic) 


## Project Overview
The Air Traffic Data Analysis project demonstrates advanced data analysis and querying capabilities using Structured Query Language (SQL). The project focuses on extracting, transforming, and analyzing air traffic data to uncover meaningful insights related to flight operations, delays, and passenger trends. This work highlights the ability to work with complex datasets and optimize queries for performance, both of which are essential skills in data-driven environments.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL:** Primary language used for data manipulation, extraction, and analysis.
- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):** Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **Tableau:** Used to visualize data and present analytical findings through interactive dashboards.
- **Python (Matplotlib):** Utilized to generate visualizations for this README.

## Features and Key Highlights
- Comprehensive data cleaning processes to handle inconsistencies and missing values.
- Use of advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and subqueries.
- Efficient query optimization to handle large datasets effectively.
- Data-driven insights into flight delays, passenger trends, and operational efficiency.
- Clear and well-documented code for easy understanding and maintenance.
- Visual representations to communicate findings effectively.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirTraffic_Submission.git
cd AirTraffic_Submission
```

### 2. Set Up the Database
Create a new database in your preferred SQL environment:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE air_traffic_db;
USE air_traffic_db;
```

### 3. Execute the SQL Script
Run the provided SQL script to create tables, clean data, and perform the analysis:
```bash
mysql -u your-username -p air_traffic_db < AirTraffic_Submission.sql
```

### 4. Review and Analyze the Results
After executing the script, use your SQL client to query the tables and views. The analysis covers:
- Flight delay patterns
- Passenger traffic trends
- Operational insights and peak periods
- Cancellations categorized by state and cause
